# Tauri-Robot
This uses Rust and Tauri to control a robot

## Getting Started

To get started make sure to first follow the prerequisites depending on your OS. Go to [this](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) link to install required dependencies. Next, make sure to have Rust and Cargo installed with [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html) link. Then install the Tauri CLI with `cargo install tauri-cli`. Once that's done run the application with `cargo tauri dev`. Then the GUI should appear and you can run your robot. Note: This is not recommended for Pis with only one CPU core and less than 2 GB of RAM. This project is best suited for the Pi 4 2, 4 or 8 GB, the CM4 2, 4, or 8 GB or the new Pi 5 4 or 8 GB.
